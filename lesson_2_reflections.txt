1.What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When we initialise a repository using the command git init, a new empty git repository is initialised.
2.How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an intermediate area between the working directory and the git repository. We can add files that we wish to commit 
to the staging area using the command git add <file name> and then when we run git commit, the entire staging area contents are added 
to the git repository.
